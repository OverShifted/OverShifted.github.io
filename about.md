My name is Sepehr and I'm mostly interested in computers, mathematics and physics. I usually program in C/C++, Rust and Python and enjoy working on low-level systems, games, and even sometimes website front-ends.

Other than that, I enjoy playing video games and cooking (so much that I have created a cookable homepage!).

And most importantly: **I use [Arch](https://archlinux.org/) btw.**
